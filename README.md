Concept:
In today’s world, using applications to send/receive mails inside or outside of current network is wildly used.
For this project you must create an application that contains the information needed.

About:
Suppose you we have a system in which clients write/edit/send emails to one or more recipients.

Requirements:
-	Users must login to their emails
-	Users can write mail inside the application
-	Users can modify unsent mails
-	Users can send mails to one or more recipients
-	Users can receive emails from others
-	Users can group mails in separate folders (tags)
-	Users can delete their emails
-	Users can block one or more senders to not receive email from them in future
-	Recipients who are mostly contacted should be found in contacts
-	Users can find recipients with previous contact by writing the first character of their email address (autocomplete)

Entities:
-	User

o	Name

o	Username

o	Password

o	Date joined

-	Email

o	Sender

o	Receiver(s)

o	Date created

o	Status (draft/sent/…)

Duty:
Design an application from UI to DB that meets the requirements with having in mind that requirements may be added in future.

Note:
-	You can add properties to entities to have a better design.
-	You must include all properties that are mentioned
-	You can design your database with your desire.

Enjoy!
